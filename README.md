# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs created for the ALX School's low-level programming and algorithm track. I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming ideas while working in the C language during these projects, which took place across the Year 1 curriculum. The following is a specific list of projects:

* [0x00-hello_world](https://github.com/Joeeazy/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)

* [0x01-variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/Joeeazy/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)

* [0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/Joeeazy/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)

* [0x03-debugging](https://github.com/Joeeazy/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)

General

 * What are make, Makefiles

    Make is a build automation tool used to compile and build projects. It uses a file called a Makefile to specify how the project should be built. A Makefile contains rules and dependencies that describe     how source files should be compiled and linked to create executable programs or libraries.

 * When, why and how to use Makefiles

    Makefiles are particularly useful in large projects with multiple source files. They help automate the build process by tracking dependencies and rebuilding only the necessary components when source cod    e changes. Makefiles are commonly used in C projects, but they can be employed for various programming languages and scenarios.
